🔧 Suggested Improvements
1. Handle Invalid Input Gracefully
Right now, if the input is empty or someone enters text (somehow), you'll get weird results.

Nudge:
Check if baseValue is empty or not a number before converting. Maybe even show a warning.

2. Improve Visual Feedback
If a user hits "Convert" with no input:

Highlight the input with red border

Shake animation?

Show an inline error like "Please enter a number!"

3. Keyboard Accessibility
Add this:

//numInput.addEventListener("keydown", function(e) {
    if (e.key === "Enter") {
        convertBtn.click()
    }
}) //

That way users can just press Enter to convert — smooth UX.

4. Preserve Decimal Places on Input
If a user enters 7.4, it works. But if you try 7.456789123, toFixed(3) gives you a clean output — maybe let the user choose how many decimal places they want?

💡 Stretch idea: Let user choose precision with a <select> or range slider.

🚀 Stretch Goal Ideas
🔁 1. Bi-directional Input
Let the user choose which direction to convert — e.g., feet to meters or meters to feet.

🌍 2. Theme Switcher (Light/Dark)
Add a toggle for light/dark mode, maybe using localStorage to save preference.

📱 3. Responsive Design
Make it super mobile-friendly. Tighten spacing, resize fonts/inputs, and make it touch-friendly.

📊 4. Conversion History
Every time a conversion happens, store it in an array and show it as a list under the results.

Bonus: Add a “clear history” button and save history in localStorage.

📦 5. Add More Unit Categories
Temperature: °C ⇄ °F

Speed: km/h ⇄ mph

Currency (mock data): USD ⇄ EUR

🎨 6. Animated Transitions
Add fade-ins or sliding transitions to the results when they update. Just a little UX sugar ✨
